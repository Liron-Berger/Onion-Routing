            A final project for the Gvahim program.
            This project offers a system that creates anonimizer based on socks5 protocol.
            The program is based on different nodes and a registry contains name, ip, and secret key of each node.
            The Registry is HTTP server, allowing register and unregister services.
            Each node is a listener which registers itself to registry and listens to a chosen port.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program works the following way:
            The client (browser) connects to the first node via socks5. Once connection is recieved the first node will look up the 
            registry for three additional random nodes.
            The first node will establish socks with the second node encrypted using second node's key.
            The first node will establish socks with the third node using third node's key.
            The first node will establish socks with the fourth node using fourth node's key.
            Once last connection is established the first node will forward the original socks connection from the client to 
            the fourth node encrypted by fourth node's key.
            In practice it will be as if browser connected directly to the fourth node via socks, thus creating an anonimizer.
